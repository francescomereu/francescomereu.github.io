              When you see free-range chicken at the grocery store, it makes sense if you assume that the chicken 
              was free to graze in a grassy pasture. Yet, that’s not always the case. 
              According to the USDA, chickens labeled “free-range” must have had access to the outside. 
              However, the regulation doesn’t specify how large the outdoor area needs to be or how long the chickens 
              must have access to it. <br> As a result, chickens can be crowded into a small outdoor space for just a few 
              minutes per day and still qualify for the free-range label. There’s also no requirement for the type 
              of outdoor space. This means that instead of grass to graze on, the chickens may only have access 
              to a small square of dirt or gravel. Furthermore, according to a report done by the Animal Welfare Institute, 
              the USDA doesn’t conduct audits on facilities to check for an outdoor space. In fact, the report found that 
              very little evidence is required to support outdoor access claims. However, this doesn’t mean that all 
              free-range chicken is a scam. <br>
              Low on cash? There are also tons of cheap dinner ideas that will go easy on your wallet. 
              But let's say you're really into chicken. You're in luck! It can be prepared in a number of tasty ways, 
              and we've come up with so many dishes bursting with different flavors—a little something for everyone 
              (yes, even the pickiest ones)—and ways to show off your cooking skills. With so many different options to choose 
              from, your family won't have to eat the same thing for months on end, even if they're begging for seconds! <br>

              Is there anything better than a well-cooked steak? Not a well done steak, of course… I’m talking about steak 
              that’s perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I like medium rare steak because it has a rich, 
              buttery flavor and a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness that disappears as soon as it’s cooked any further. 
              It’s that exact moment of doneness that makes this task seem like a daunting feat. I’m a former restaurant chef, 
              and I’d love to share a few steak-cooking secrets that will help you pull off medium rare. <br>
              A medium rare steak has a warm, red center that oozes with juicy, beef-forward flavor. You’ve officially reached 
              medium rare when you hit 130° to 135°F, a temperature at which the proteins within the meat start to denature 
              but can’t fully finish. The result is a steak with the perfect amount of tender chewiness. Since the moisture 
              inside the steak can’t escape at these low temperatures, your steak turns out as juicy as possible.<br>
              The most fool-proof way to know for sure that your steak is in the medium rare range is to use an instant-read 
              thermometer. Sure, you could follow a time-and-temperature chart based on the thickness of the steak, or use the 
              touch-test method (the center of the steak should feel like the space between your thumb and forefinger). 
              But a thermometer allows you to know—not guess—that your steak has reached the medium rare range.<br>

              Nigirizushi, or nigiri is made with special sushi rice treated with vinegar . This vinegared rice, balled and 
              pressed with two fingers forms the base of the nigiri. A slice of raw fish is then placed on the rice base, 
              at times with a speck of wasabi. Sashimi is slices of fresh raw fish (sometimes, meat) presented with several 
              types of garnishes. The quality of sashimi lies in the freshness of fish, the way it’s sliced, presented and 
              garnished. Common garnishes include shredded daikon radish, shiso leaves, or toasted nori (sea weed).
              Both nigiri and sashimi are accompanied with pickled ginger and wasabi with soy sauce. <br>
              Nigiri in Japanese means two fingers (ni = two, giri = fingers). Nigiri sushi gets its name from the rice which 
              has to be of a very specific portion and fit on the chef’s “two fingers” when pressing. Sushi is a Japanese 
              term that refers to anything made with vinegared rice. Sashimi is a Japanese term for pierced flesh (Sashi = 
              pierced, mi = flesh). The term may have originated from the culinary practice of sticking the fish’s tail and 
              fin to the slices in identifying the fish being eaten. Another possibility for the name could come from the 
              traditional method of harvesting - ‘Sashimi Grade’ fish is caught by individual hand line. As soon as the fish 
              is landed, it is pierced with a sharp spike and placed in a body of ice. <br>
              These are popular because most sushi beginners find these easier on the palate. You will also often find Tako (octopus), Ika (squid), Kani 
              (crab), Ikura (salmon roe), Awagi (abalone) and Kazunoko (herring roe), which have a distinct flavor and takes some 
              getting used to. Favorite fish for sashimi include Maguro (tuna), Sake (salmon), Hamachi (yellowtail), Tai 
              (red snapper), Kihada (yellowfin tuna), Saba (mackerel), Tako (Octopus) and even raw red meats such as Gyuunotataki 
              (beef), Basashi (horse) and Torisashi (chicken). Toriwasa (slightly seared chicken), a variation of Torisashi, 
              is also a popular Sashimi delicacy. <br>
